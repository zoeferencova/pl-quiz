Premier League Quiz App for Bloc

For a Bloc assignment, I was tasked with creating a quiz app on a topic of my choice using jQuery. Being a Premier League enthusiast, I chose to create a Premier League quiz. The app is fully accessible, responsive, and seamlessly guides users through the quiz, providing consistent feedback and keeping track of the userâ€™s score. When designing the app, I used the Premier League website color scheme to keep my quiz on brand and aesthetically appealing. Overall, working on this project reinforced my confidence in my capabilities with jQuery and I was able to create a fun web app in the process.
